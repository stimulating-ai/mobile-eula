## Commercial License Terms
If you maintain an active paid subscription that includes commercial rights at the time User Content is created, you are granted a **Commercial License** to that User Content. This Commercial License is:  

- **Scope of Use:** A worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, transferable, and sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and create derivative works of the User Content generated through the App.

- **Restrictions:**  
  - You may not use the App itself (outside of the generated User Content) for commercial resale, service bureau, or similar business models unless expressly permitted by the Developer.  
  - You may not imply that the Developer or the App endorses your commercial use of User Content without express written permission.  
  - You remain solely responsible for ensuring that your use of User Content complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and third-party rights.  

Any User Content generated when you do **not** have an active subscription with commercial rights is licensed only under the **Non-Commercial License**, meaning you may use it for personal, educational, or other non-commercial purposes but not for financial gain, promotion, or business use.
